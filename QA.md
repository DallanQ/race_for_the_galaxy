[do-you-draw-a-card-at-the-end-of-the-round](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/696088/do-you-draw-a-card-at-the-end-of-the-round)

> Do you draw a card at the end of each round?

No you don’t draw a card at the end of each round. Cards are drawn through specific actions, like the Explore phase or special card effects during other phases.

[production-phase-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/599033/production-phase-question)

> Do grey worlds produce goods?  

No they don't, gray worlds do not produce goods. Gray worlds are typically "windfall" worlds, meaning they may start with a good when they are initially settled, but they cannot produce new goods during the Produce phase. Only colored worlds (blue, brown, green, and yellow) can produce goods.

[scoring-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1093697/scoring-question)

> Let's say I have 3 cards with a hieroglyphic that says I get a VP and a card for selling a good. Only 1 world produces and sells goods. Do I get 3 VPs and 3 cards every time I sell 1 good, or does 1 heiroglyphic only apply to 1 transaction?

No, you only get 1 VP and 1 card per transaction when you sell a single good during the Consume phase.
Note that You have to consume as much as you can and cannot keep a resource for a later usage neither, but you can choose the order in which you apply consume powers.

[multiple-trade-abilities](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/284334/multiple-trade-abilities)

> When you choose "Consume: Trade" and one good is traded, can you apply all applicable trade abilities which are on worlds or developments in your tableau?

Yes, when you choose "Consume: Trade", you can apply all applicable trade abilities from your worlds or developments in your tableau to that single trade transaction. This includes those which are due to the specific kind of good sold as well as those which are due to selling any kind of good.

> Let say I already developed "Replicant Robots" (which gives me -2 to place world) can I develop another "Replicant Robots" to have a -4 for placing world? (there are 2 Replicant Robots in the deck).

No, there cannot be more than one card with the same name in your tableau. you can't stack the effects to achieve a -4 cost but you can develop another "Replicant Robots" card if you draw it. This simply means that you can only develop one copy of "Replicant Robots" at a time in your tableau, which replaces the previous copy in your tableau and gives you a -2 cost for placing world. You can't have both cards in play simultaneously.

[playing-on-bga-alien-rosetta-stone-world-rules-que](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/965037/playing-on-bga-alien-rosetta-stone-world-rules-que)

> Is the Alien Rosetta Stone an Alien card or not?

Yes, the Alien Rosetta Stone is an Alien card but it does not produce Alien technology goods (or a windfall world for those goods) and therefore it triggers a 2 points reward. This also means that the colony ship can be used to colonize the Alien Rosetta Stone World, since that world doesn't produce Alien technology goods.

[space-mercenaries-plus-improved-logistics](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1087399/space-mercenaries-plus-improved-logistics)

> I was playing with Improved Logistics on the tableau. I chose develop, settle, and produce phases. After developing Space Mercenaries, I discarded a card to settle a 2-defense military world, which raised my military temporarily. When I used Improved Logistics to settle again, my two 3-defense military worlds were grayed out, indicating they couldn’t be settled. I thought I would be able to discard another card to reach 3 military strength for this phase. Why couldn’t I settle these worlds?

You need to use the discard power all at once for each settle action. You can only use a power once per phase, so when you discarded one card to gain 1 military for the first settle action, that counted as your single use of the power for that settle. This means you couldn’t discard another card to add 1 more military for a second attempt to settle.

[do-discounts-for-planets-stack](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1901858/do-discounts-for-planets-stack)

> Do discount for planets stack?

If you are using Improved Logistics to settle the world, you don't receive the discount for Alien Rosetta Stone World until the phase is over. From page 5 of the manual,
"The powers of various cards can alter the settle rules if a player has them in his tableau before the settle phase begins." This means that even though you are settling twice, it's still all part of the same settle phase, so your newly acquired settle powers are restricted from use until the next settle phase.

[need-help-with-some-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2202581/need-help-with-some-rules)

> If i have for example 3 consume powers (that need 1 good) and only 2 goods, do i choose what consume powers i make use of?

Yes, you choose which consume powers to use with the goods you have available.

> When a power says "up to" it means if i do that power i have to use all goods if i can? but do i still get 1 point, or do i get 1 point for each good discarded??

The "up to" means you can choose to use any number of goods (from 0 up to the total you have). You get 1 point for each good discarded with that power, so the points you gain depend on the number of goods you choose to use, not on using all of them.

> why does some cards like "Gateway station" have a big negative number?

The negative number means it comes before zero (zero to a positive integer were designed before new cards intended to be start worlds with earlier priority).

> Why can't I develop a duplicate Mining Robots card?

You can’t develop a duplicate Mining Robots card (any other card) because the rules state that you’re not allowed to have multiple copies of the same development or world in your tableau. This simply means you cannot have more than one of each development or world.

> What is the significance (if any) of a world with a gray shade versus a white shade on the inside of the circle?

Gray shaded worlds are non-producing worlds. White-shaded worlds, distinguished by a colored halo, are Windfall worlds. Windfall worlds produce a good (matching the halo color) when first settled, and afterward only produce when specific powers are triggered, such as the bonus from calling the Produce phase.

[can-i-conquer-two-military-worlds-when-two-players](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/329393/can-i-conquer-two-military-worlds-when-two-players)

> If more than one player chooses Settle (III) as their action card (role?), can a player re-use military points in order to conquer TWO worlds in that one round?

No, a player cannot re-use military points to conquer multiple worlds in a single Settle phase, in a regular game, the Settle action occurs only once per round, and each player can settle only one world, no matter how many players chose the Settle role.
However, in a 2-player experienced game, a player can choose two Settle actions in one turn.
According to the 2 player game rules, "If a player chooses either two Develop or two Settle actions, then two complete, non-sequential phases of that type occur (with this player receiving a bonus in each). Powers gained in the first phase can be used in the second one."

[not-clear-on-colony-ship](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/329357/not-clear-on-colony-ship)

> Can you reduce a green production world to zero, or blue, or brown?

Yes you can, the Colony Ship allows you to place any world that normally requires payment, by discarding the Colony Ship instead. However, it cannot be used on Alien (yellow) worlds. If you have a Contact Specialist in play, you can use it to place non-Alien military worlds by paying instead of conquering. The Colony Ship then lets you bypass this cost, allowing you to place the military world for free.

[do-sale-bonuses-add-up](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/325210/do-sale-bonuses-add-up)

> Do sale bonuses add up?

Sale bonuses do add up. When you sell a good, you can apply all relevant trade bonuses from your tableau.
While some cards offer trade bonuses that apply only to specific goods listed on that card, more common bonuses can be applied to every trade.

[session-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/355340/session-questions)

> Do goods count toward total card victory conditions?

Goods do not contribute to the card victory conditions. The 12 built (face up) card in the tableau is the game end condition. Remember to keep goods face-down.

> Should the VP count be adjusted each turn to ensure it matches the card values, considering that variances occur when exchanging goods for VPs?

No it shouldn't, you only take VP chips for VPs earned via consume powers. For the intrinsic value of the cards, just add them up at the end. Note that this will fiddle with the game length.

> How many goods may be consumed on the consume phase?

From page 6 of the manual, "Each consume power can be used only once in a consume phase. Some powers allow
multiple goods, “up to” some number, to be discarded, with each good producing an
effect. Such powers must be fully used, if possible, when invoked."
This means each good may only be used in one consume power and the total number of goods consumed may be none, some, or all of the goods you currently have available, depending on your available powers.

> If a player has no cards in play with consume powers and did not elect a consume action, are they unable to consume, even if another player had chosen the consume action?

Yes even if they chose the consume phase, they would be unable to consume. They may be able to trade one card if they took Consume:trade, but may not consume any goods.

> Are bonuses to settling planets cumulative, meaning that if you have two or more cards with a -1 cost for settling, the total settle cost would be -2?

Yes, bonuses to settling planets are cumulative. If you have two or more cards that provide a -1 cost for settling, the total settle cost would indeed be -2. This means that you can stack the benefits from multiple cards to reduce the cost of settling planets even further, allowing for more strategic plays.

The red setting sun symbol indicates that the card is a Rebel Military world. This icon is somewhat redundant since the "REBEL" keyword is already in the title.

[windfall-worlds-production](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/250717/windfall-worlds-production)

> Do windfall worlds produce on the turn they are played (providing their windfall)?

Windfall worlds do not produce on the turn they are played. The Produce effects only occur during the Produce phase, while worlds are placed during the Settle phase, so any Produce effects cannot fire.

[develop-phase-bonus-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/439211/develop-phase-bonus-question)

> In the Develop phase, if I have multiple cards with a +1 card bonus, do I receive multiple bonus cards? Additionally, do I receive these bonuses only if I choose the Develop phase with my action card, or also if my opponent chooses it? Lastly, do I still get the bonus(es) even if I don’t buy any improvements during the Develop phase?

Yes, you receive each of the +1 card bonuses during the Develop phase, even if you didn’t select the phase and even if you don’t buy any improvements.

[alpha-centauri-bonuses](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/687912/alpha-centauri-bonuses)

> Does the third VP scoring condition, “1 VP per other black/red world,” apply to any settlement card, or only to those specifically labeled as "world"?

Any card with a round icon in the top left is considered a world, and you can only settle worlds. The scoring condition means you earn 1 VP per other world, whether military (red) or non-military (black).

[settle-bonus-timing](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1316827/settle-bonus-timing)

> Do you draw the Settle Bonus card after placing a world or at the end of the settle phase?

Yes, you draw the Settle Bonus card after placing a world. According to page 5 of the manual, "Players who chose Settle, as the bonus, draw one card after placing and paying for (or conquering) a world." This means you do not draw the Settle Bonus card at the end of the Settle phase.

[specialized-military-strength-with-contact-special](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3252967/specialized-military-strength-with-contact-special)

> If I had played the Contact Specialist after replacing my starting world with the 3-cost grey alien world, would I still have +2 military strength against alien worlds, or would the Contact Specialist's -1 general military strength reduce it to +1?

When attempting to conquer a world, you combine your military strength with any specialized military bonuses. Since the Contact Specialist provides a -1 penalty to your general military strength, this penalty applies regardless of other effects. Therefore, you would have a total of +1 military strength against alien (yellow) worlds in this scenario.

[starting-world-choice](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/464711/starting-world-choice)

> How are starting worlds chosen if two players want the same one? Do players select from among four face-down shuffled worlds, or is there another method?

In the base set, starting worlds are dealt randomly. According to the rules on page 2 of the manual, "Find and shuffle the five **start worlds**. Deal one world face up to each player." If using preset hands, you deal out worlds 1-N randomly, where N is the number of players, and then match the preset hands to the worlds each player received.

[pilgrimage-world](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1770279/pilgrimage-world)

> Can I sacrifice all my three goods to Pilgrimage World first to receive the total victory points, or do I have to use other consume powers before using Pilgrimage World?

Yes, you can sacrifice all three of your goods to Pilgrimage World. However, you cannot leave any goods behind for a different consume power. You can use your consume actions in any order, but once you choose a consume action, you must use it to its fullest extent.

> Why can't I select the value "0" during gambling in Keldon's implementation?

You can't select the value '0' during gambling in Keldon's implementation because the card specifies a range of '1-7,' which excludes '0.' However, the house always wins on '0,' and the '0' column is included on the chart to show the total card distribution.

Yes, you can play Rebel Miners for free because Contact Specialist changes Rebel Miners from a Defense 2 world into a Cost 1 world, and Alpha Centauri applies a 1 card discount on normal brown worlds.

[rules-clairification-help](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/448063/rules-clairification-help)

> Do gray worlds produce goods?

They produce nothing. There is one (Galactic Engineers) that has an ability to let you produce on an arbitrary windfall, and other (Alien Rosetta Stone World) that will let you produce on an Alien windfall. From page 7 of the manual, "Action: place a good on each production world (worlds with colored, solid circles) without a good , by taking a card face down — without looking at it — from the card supply and putting it on top of the world’s lower right portion (to avoid hiding the world’s VPs and powers). This good is of the kind indicated by the color of the world’s solid circle (and the color of the corresponding Produce power)." This means that the gray worlds are neither windfall nor production worlds; you place them for their powers and victory points.

[consume-x2-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/850047/consume-x2-question)

> When choosing consume x2 do I get x2 for all the vps earned on that phase or only for the first good I consume?

When choosing Consume x2, you double the Victory Points (VPs) for all goods consumed during that phase, not just the first one. This means that every consume action that generates VPs in that phase will earn double the VPs.

> If a card with (1 vp and 1 card draw) is taking place in the consume x2 phase I should get 2 vps and 1 card draw?

Yes, in the consume x2 phase you will get 2 Vps and 1 card draw because the consume x2 bonus doubles the Vps earned.

> Can I use a card power of a certain phase if I do not perform the action associated with that phase?

Yes, you can still use a card's power for a specific phase even if you don’t perform the action associated with that phase, as long as the phase is active because a player chose it. This simply means that you are benefiting parasitically from another player's actions, I believe that they call it "leeching".
