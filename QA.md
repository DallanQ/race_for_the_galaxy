> Do you draw a card at the end of each round?

No you don’t draw a card at the end of each round. Cards are drawn through specific actions, like the Explore phase or special card effects during other phases.

[production-phase-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/599033/production-phase-question)

> Do grey worlds produce goods?  

No they don't, gray worlds do not produce goods. Gray worlds are typically "windfall" worlds, meaning they may start with a good when they are initially settled, but they cannot produce new goods during the Produce phase. Only colored worlds (blue, brown, green, and yellow) can produce goods.

[scoring-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1093697/scoring-question)

> Let's say I have 3 cards with a hieroglyphic that says I get a VP and a card for selling a good. Only 1 world produces and sells goods. Do I get 3 VPs and 3 cards every time I sell 1 good, or does 1 heiroglyphic only apply to 1 transaction?

No, you only get 1 VP and 1 card per transaction when you sell a single good during the Consume phase.
Note that You have to consume as much as you can and cannot keep a resource for a later usage neither, but you can choose the order in which you apply consume powers.

[multiple-trade-abilities](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/284334/multiple-trade-abilities)

> When you choose "Consume: Trade" and one good is traded, can you apply all applicable trade abilities which are on worlds or developments in your tableau?

Yes, when you choose "Consume: Trade", you can apply all applicable trade abilities from your worlds or developments in your tableau to that single trade transaction. This includes those which are due to the specific kind of good sold as well as those which are due to selling any kind of good.

> Let say I already developed "Replicant Robots" (which gives me -2 to place world) can I develop another "Replicant Robots" to have a -4 for placing world? (there are 2 Replicant Robots in the deck).

No, there cannot be more than one card with the same name in your tableau. you can't stack the effects to achieve a -4 cost but you can develop another "Replicant Robots" card if you draw it. This simply means that you can only develop one copy of "Replicant Robots" at a time in your tableau, which replaces the previous copy in your tableau and gives you a -2 cost for placing world. You can't have both cards in play simultaneously.

> Is the Alien Rosetta Stone an Alien card or not?

Yes, the Alien Rosetta Stone is an Alien card but it does not produce Alien technology goods (or a windfall world for those goods) and therefore it triggers a 2 points reward. This also means that the colony ship can be used to colonize the Alien Rosetta Stone World, since that world doesn't produce Alien technology goods.

[space-mercenaries-plus-improved-logistics](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1087399/space-mercenaries-plus-improved-logistics)

> I was playing with Improved Logistics on the tableau. I chose develop, settle, and produce phases. After developing Space Mercenaries, I discarded a card to settle a 2-defense military world, which raised my military temporarily. When I used Improved Logistics to settle again, my two 3-defense military worlds were grayed out, indicating they couldn’t be settled. I thought I would be able to discard another card to reach 3 military strength for this phase. Why couldn’t I settle these worlds?

You need to use the discard power all at once for each settle action. You can only use a power once per phase, so when you discarded one card to gain 1 military for the first settle action, that counted as your single use of the power for that settle. This means you couldn’t discard another card to add 1 more military for a second attempt to settle.

[do-discounts-for-planets-stack](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1901858/do-discounts-for-planets-stack)

> Do discount for planets stack?

If you are using Improved Logistics to settle the world, you don't receive the discount for Alien Rosetta Stone World until the phase is over. From page 5 of the manual,
"The powers of various cards can alter the settle rules if a player has them in his tableau before the settle phase begins." This means that even though you are settling twice, it's still all part of the same settle phase, so your newly acquired settle powers are restricted from use until the next settle phase.

[need-help-with-some-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2202581/need-help-with-some-rules)

> If i have for example 3 consume powers (that need 1 good) and only 2 goods, do i choose what consume powers i make use of?

Yes, you choose which consume powers to use with the goods you have available.

> When a power says "up to" it means if i do that power i have to use all goods if i can? but do i still get 1 point, or do i get 1 point for each good discarded??

The "up to" means you can choose to use any number of goods (from 0 up to the total you have). You get 1 point for each good discarded with that power, so the points you gain depend on the number of goods you choose to use, not on using all of them.

> why does some cards like "Gateway station" have a big negative number?

The negative number means it comes before zero (zero to a positive integer were designed before new cards intended to be start worlds with earlier priority).

You can’t develop a duplicate Mining Robots card (any other card) because the rules state that you’re not allowed to have multiple copies of the same development or world in your tableau. This simply means you cannot have more than one of each development or world.

> What is the significance (if any) of a world with a gray shade versus a white shade on the inside of the circle?

Gray shaded worlds are non-producing worlds. White-shaded worlds, distinguished by a colored halo, are Windfall worlds. Windfall worlds produce a good (matching the halo color) when first settled, and afterward only produce when specific powers are triggered, such as the bonus from calling the Produce phase.

> If more than one player chooses Settle (III) as their action card (role?), can a player re-use military points in order to conquer TWO worlds in that one round?

No, a player cannot re-use military points to conquer multiple worlds in a single Settle phase, in a regular game, the Settle action occurs only once per round, and each player can settle only one world, no matter how many players chose the Settle role.
However, in a 2-player experienced game, a player can choose two Settle actions in one turn.
According to the 2 player game rules, "If a player chooses either two Develop or two Settle actions, then two complete, non-sequential phases of that type occur (with this player receiving a bonus in each). Powers gained in the first phase can be used in the second one."

[not-clear-on-colony-ship](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/329357/not-clear-on-colony-ship)

> Can you reduce a green production world to zero, or blue, or brown?

Yes you can, the Colony Ship allows you to place any world that normally requires payment, by discarding the Colony Ship instead. However, it cannot be used on Alien (yellow) worlds. If you have a Contact Specialist in play, you can use it to place non-Alien military worlds by paying instead of conquering. The Colony Ship then lets you bypass this cost, allowing you to place the military world for free.

> Do sale bonuses add up?

Sale bonuses do add up. When you sell a good, you can apply all relevant trade bonuses from your tableau.
While some cards offer trade bonuses that apply only to specific goods listed on that card, more common bonuses can be applied to every trade.

[session-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/355340/session-questions)

> Do goods count toward total card victory conditions?

Goods do not contribute to the card victory conditions. The 12 built (face up) card in the tableau is the game end condition. Remember to keep goods face-down.

> Should the VP count be adjusted each turn to ensure it matches the card values, considering that variances occur when exchanging goods for VPs?

No it shouldn't, you only take VP chips for VPs earned via consume powers. For the intrinsic value of the cards, just add them up at the end. Note that this will fiddle with the game length.

> How many goods may be consumed on the consume phase?

From page 6 of the manual, "Each consume power can be used only once in a consume phase. Some powers allow
multiple goods, “up to” some number, to be discarded, with each good producing an
effect. Such powers must be fully used, if possible, when invoked."
This means each good may only be used in one consume power and the total number of goods consumed may be none, some, or all of the goods you currently have available, depending on your available powers.

> If a player has no cards in play with consume powers and did not elect a consume action, are they unable to consume, even if another player had chosen the consume action?

Yes even if they chose the consume phase, they would be unable to consume. They may be able to trade one card if they took Consume:trade, but may not consume any goods.

> Are bonuses to settling planets cumulative, meaning that if you have two or more cards with a -1 cost for settling, the total settle cost would be -2?

Yes, bonuses to settling planets are cumulative. If you have two or more cards that provide a -1 cost for settling, the total settle cost would indeed be -2. This means that you can stack the benefits from multiple cards to reduce the cost of settling planets even further, allowing for more strategic plays.

Any card with a round icon in the top left is considered a world, and you can only settle worlds. The scoring condition means you earn 1 VP per other world, whether military (red) or non-military (black).

[settle-bonus-timing](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1316827/settle-bonus-timing)

Yes, you draw the Settle Bonus card after placing a world. According to page 5 of the manual, "Players who chose Settle, as the bonus, draw one card after placing and paying for (or conquering) a world." This means you do not draw the Settle Bonus card at the end of the Settle phase.

> If I had played the Contact Specialist after replacing my starting world with the 3-cost grey alien world, would I still have +2 military strength against alien worlds, or would the Contact Specialist's -1 general military strength reduce it to +1?

When attempting to conquer a world, you combine your military strength with any specialized military bonuses. Since the Contact Specialist provides a -1 penalty to your general military strength, this penalty applies regardless of other effects. Therefore, you would have a total of +1 military strength against alien (yellow) worlds in this scenario.

In the base set, starting worlds are dealt randomly. According to the rules on page 2 of the manual, "Find and shuffle the five **start worlds**. Deal one world face up to each player." If using preset hands, you deal out worlds 1-N randomly, where N is the number of players, and then match the preset hands to the worlds each player received.

You can't select the value '0' during gambling in Keldon's implementation because the card specifies a range of '1-7,' which excludes '0.' However, the house always wins on '0,' and the '0' column is included on the chart to show the total card distribution.

[rules-clairification-help](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/448063/rules-clairification-help)

> Do gray worlds produce goods?

They produce nothing. There is one (Galactic Engineers) that has an ability to let you produce on an arbitrary windfall, and other (Alien Rosetta Stone World) that will let you produce on an Alien windfall. From page 7 of the manual, "Action: place a good on each production world (worlds with colored, solid circles) without a good , by taking a card face down — without looking at it — from the card supply and putting it on top of the world’s lower right portion (to avoid hiding the world’s VPs and powers). This good is of the kind indicated by the color of the world’s solid circle (and the color of the corresponding Produce power)." This means that the gray worlds are neither windfall nor production worlds; you place them for their powers and victory points.

[consume-x2-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/850047/consume-x2-question)

> When choosing consume x2 do I get x2 for all the vps earned on that phase or only for the first good I consume?

When choosing Consume x2, you double the Vps for all goods consumed during that phase, not just the first one. This means that every consume action that generates VPs in that phase will earn double the VPs.

> If a card with (1 vp and 1 card draw) is taking place in the consume x2 phase I should get 2 vps and 1 card draw?

Yes, in the consume x2 phase you will get 2 Vps and 1 card draw because the consume x2 bonus doubles the Vps earned.

> Can I use a card power of a certain phase if I do not perform the action associated with that phase?

Yes, you can still use a card's power for a specific phase even if you don’t perform the action associated with that phase, as long as the phase is active because a player chose it. This simply means that you are benefiting parasitically from another player's actions, I believe that they call it "leeching".

> Is it acceptable to use cards from the discard pile when producing goods, or to put consumed goods back into the draw deck, and would either of these changes significantly alter the game?

The goods come from the draw deck by design to prevent players from mining the deck for specific cards using +5 explore. This mechanic also ensures that certain advantageous cards are not always accessible, as they may enter play as goods and not enter players' hands until the next shuffle.

> Could tokens be used to represent goods?

Using tokens to represent goods could reduce the strategic tension in the game. When cards are used as goods, they are temporarily out of play and can't be utilized for other actions. With tokens, no card would be removed from play while serving as a good, which changes the gameplay dynamics.

[the-use-of-produce-symbols-on-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3201015/the-use-of-produce-symbols-on-cards)

> What is the usefulness of produce symbols (like a colored card) in the V-section of cards if the produce action produces on every world anyway?

Only production worlds produce (not windfall). While there is some redundancy, some cards have additional produce powers, such as “draw a card after producing a good on this world.” The current design allows you to only scan the V row during the production phase, making it both redundant and elegant.

[card-effects](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/965127/card-effects)

> Most of the cards have "effects" next to one (or more) Roman Numbers, right? When action 4 (Consume) is active, and I have five goods (A, B, C, D, E) along with three cards that each have one effect listed next to their number 4, do I apply each effect from the cards to good A, or do I apply only one effect by choosing any one from those cards and ignoring the others? Is it correct that each good can only have one effect applied to it at a time, and once an effect is used for good A, can that same effect be applied to the next good, B?

Yes, most cards do have effects listed next to one or more Roman Numbers, indicating the different actions or benefits that can be applied during gameplay. However, you do not apply each effect to good A; you can only apply one effect at a time for each good. Specifically, you choose any one effect from the cards with effects listed next to their number 4 and ignore the others. Each good can only have one effect applied to it at a time, meaning that the consumption of a single good can only gain the benefit of the consume power of one world or development. Generally, a consume power applies to a single good, but there are exceptions for specific powers that allow you to consume multiple goods simultaneously. For example, according to page 10 of the manual, "The player may discard up to 2 cards from their hand to gain 1 VP apiece," or "Discard 2 goods (of any kind, possibly the same) to gain 3 VP chips." In those cases, you can apply the same effect to multiple goods as specified by the power.

> If I have the Interstellar Bank in my tableau and someone else plays the Develop card but I don't develop, do I still get to draw a card?

Yes, you still get to draw a card from the Interstellar Bank even if you do not develop. The "draw a card" icon is separate from the settle action, indicating that you do not need to perform the development action to benefit from it. Additionally, you must draw the card before deciding whether or not to play a development, which may influence your decisions during that phase. From page 9 of the manual, "Draw 1 card at the start of the Develop phase."

[6-development](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1060766/6-development)

> Can you use all the options available on the 6 development cards with a '?' to gain VP, or can you only choose one option to get the points?

You can score for all the options available on the card if you complete each one before the end of the game. This means that if there are multiple scoring options on the card, you need to complete each one to score them all.

Yes, you can produce a gene during the production phase using the genetics lab. Then, during the consume phase, you can use the terraforming robots to consume that gene as a rare elements good. This means that the card's effect allows you to change the kind of good produced, effectively treating the produced gene as a rare element for consumption.

Is this a bug, or do the rules state that the game only ends if the VP pool goes into a negative number?

The game ends at the *end of the round* in which the initial VP pool is exhausted (with additional VP chips added as needed to finish out that round). The pool does not need to go "negative".
Since Prestige is earned at the start of a round, it is possible that the prestige leader's VP (or VPs if a prestige lead tie exists) exactly drains the pool *before* actions are selected, thereby giving you the sense that the game is going on when it shouldn't be, even though in fact you're just finishing out the final round.

Yes. If you select the "Consume Trade" action card, you must first sell a good (if you have one.) After you do that, if you have any other consume powers you can use, you use them, but it's possible that you sold your only good and have no other usable consume powers.

> If I choose Consume Trade, does that mean I cannot also perform Trade for VP x2 in the same turn, and vice versa?

They are two separate action cards, so you cannot play both at once. The only exception is in the two-player advanced game.

> When Improved Logistics is in play, the cardholder may settle a second world during the settle phase. Does the player need to pay the cost (either in cards or military might) for the second world to settle it?

Yes, when Improved Logistics is in play, the player must still pay the cost (either in cards or military might) to settle the second world.

[additive-consume-power-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2928371/additive-consume-power-question)

> If I have two consuming powers in my tableau, Freihandels Union and Neue Aussteiger, and I use Freihandels Union to consume 3 luxury goods, gaining 3 VP and 3 cards, does that render Neue Aussteiger useless since I no longer have any luxury goods left? Or is the power of Neue Aussteiger additive, allowing me to use it alongside Freihandels Union to gain 4 cards instead of 3?

You can only consume each good once, but if a good can be consumed by multiple powers, you get to choose which power to use. In your example, if you have 3 Novelty (blue) goods and you consume them all with Freihandels Union, then Neue Aussteiger has no utility. You could choose to consume 2 goods with Freihandels Union (since it allows you to consume "up to 3") and then consume the remaining 1 with Neue Aussteiger, but that would generally be a less optimal choice.

To clarify, consume powers are not additive; you cannot combine them to gain additional benefits.

[rule-multiple-consume-powers-stack-or-select](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/273871/rule-multiple-consume-powers-stack-or-select)

> If I have multiple powers available, can I use all of them in a single turn?

> For example, let's say you have the Public Works power, which gives you +1 VP when you discard any good, and you also have a planet that grants +1 VP and +1 card for discarding a good. If you discard one blue good, how many VP do you receive, and where do those points come from? (For simplicity, let's assume you haven't played that phase, so there's no x2 bonus). Additionally, if you have both a blue good and a brown good, can you use the same powers multiple times in one turn, or are you limited to using each power just once?

No, the consume powers do not stack. You must activate each of your consume powers, but you can choose the order in which they occur. However, if you run out of goods, some powers may end up doing nothing.When a consume power allows for consuming multiple goods (like x2 or x3), you must fully utilize that power when you activate it. According to the manual, "Each good being discarded applies to only one consume power." Therefore, if you have multiple powers available, you can use each of them, but you can't combine the effects from the same goods across those powers.

[consumetrade-do-i-need-a-dollar-power-in-my-tablea](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2909154/consumetrade-do-i-need-a-dollar-power-in-my-tablea)

> If I choose the action Consume/Trade and can trade in a good first as my perk, do I need to have a $ power in my tableau to perform this trade, or can I trade the good without any power?

> Additionally, does the rule book on page 8 indicate that I am allowed to choose ONE of the $ powers in my tableau for the trade? Can I have multiple $ powers but only use one at a time?

You must sell a good if you select Consume Trade and have a good available at the beginning of the phase. You will receive the base value for that good, which is either 2, 3, 4, or 5 cards for blue, brown, green, or yellow goods, respectively. If you also have applicable $ powers in your tableau, those are additive to the base value.
You cannot use these $ powers unless you have selected Trade (or have the 6-development that allows it). The powers are cumulative as long as they apply to the good being traded; however, some powers may only apply to goods from specific worlds or of specific colors.

> If my tableau has 2 instances of a 6-point development card, do I score VPs for each one, or do I only score once for having that card in play?

You shouldn't have two of the same development cards in your tableau. From page 4 of the manual, "a player may not build a given development if another copy of it is currently in their tableau". Therefore, since you cannot have multiple instances of the same development card, you cannot score VPs for each one or score once for having both cards in play.

[question-on-consumption](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/380595/question-on-consumption)

> If I do have goods but no consume powers, do I lose the goods and take no points, or do I simply keep the goods?

That's correct. If you have no consume powers you cannot consume, or be forced to consume. You get to keep the goods.

Note that you can still take Trade - Consume and can still Trade a good.

[negative-red-and-blue-numbers](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3017231/negative-red-and-blue-numbers)

> Are the 10 cards with numbers ranging from -6 to +8 advanced starting cards, and why are some red and some blue?

The red are starting military worlds and the blue are starting non military worlds. When starting a game, randomly deal one red and one blue to each player. Each player decides which one to keep after seeing starting hand. The integers are used to determine player order when it makes a difference which is not that common actually (low integer goes first). The reason some are negative is that they were added to the set later and needed to come before others with regard to player order.

[newbie-question-about-consume](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/602811/newbie-question-about-consume)

> Could someone explain the exact stages of play when one or more players choose either of the Consume cards in the Consume phase?

If one or both players choose Consume Trade, then each player who chose this card first picks one good to trade, adds up all trade bonuses matching the traded good, discards the good, and takes the corresponding number of cards. After that, both players must consume all goods they can using their consume powers on cards, choosing which goods to consume in what order but cannot hold a good if there’s a matching consume power.

For Consume x2, players skip the trade phase and simply take double the VPs they normally would, while still consuming goods if possible. Players can also consume goods in a specific order to retain more goods—for example, if they have a green and a blue good, a green-only consume power, and an any-color consume power, they may consume the green at the any-color power, preserving the blue good.

[sell-goods](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1152998/sell-goods)
> I would like to know what happens in this case:

> Player 1: has 3 world witch all have goods on them.

> Player 2: has 2 worlds with goods on.

> Player 3: has no world with goods.

> Player 1: chooses trading for double VP

> Player 2: chooses trading for hand cards

> Player 3: any other phase than 4.

> Player 1: has 3 cards which says +1 VP

> Player 2: has 1 card which says +2 VP

> Player 3: who cares

> Can Player 1 sell all of his goods and double the VP, or just one good and double the VP with all bonuses added? Similarly, must Player 2 sell all his goods for normal bonuses without doubling, or can he sell only one of his goods and keep the rest?

No, Player 1 cannot sell all goods for double VP. Consumption is required if possible, though consume powers may be used in any order, which can result in unconsumed goods. As stated on page 6 of the manual, “Consumption is mandatory. However, consume powers can be invoked in any desired order, even if this results in some unconsumed goods left over that could have been consumed with a different order (due to their kinds or number not matching the player’s remaining unused consume powers).” This means Player 1 may sell only one good with the Trade bonus for cards before consuming the remaining goods. This results in a single good being traded for double VPs with bonuses added, while Player 2 must follow the standard consumption rule: selling only one good at the usual trade bonus (one good for 2 VPs in this case) and keeping the rest if desired.

[why-are-discarded-cards-placed-face-down](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/954170/why-are-discarded-cards-placed-face-down)

> Is there a reason discarded cards must be placed in a messy, face-down pile instead of a neat, face-up pile where all cards are oriented the same way? Can I ignore this rule and arrange the discard pile to look more aesthetically pleasing?

The purpose of discarding cards face-down in a messy pile is to ensure the discard pile is easily distinguishable from the draw pile, reducing the chance of confusion between them. Additionally, face-down discards prevent players from gaining information about which cards remain in the deck.

[clarification-on-produce-power](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/257167/clarification-on-produce-power)

> What does the specific rare card symbol under the produce power of Rebel Miners indicate, and where does it go? Can it be used on a windfall world if I didn’t choose the production phase, and what additional benefit does it provide given that I already produce a rare good on this card?

All worlds with a solid color inside the circle will produce a good of that color in any produce phase if the world doesn’t already have a good. This icon is simply a reminder of that. Windfall worlds only produce goods on your produce phases (for one windfall world without a good) or via a produce power allowing placement on a windfall world, indicated by a circle with a multicolored or solid halo around it.

Once a card is placed in the tableau, it remains there until the end of the game unless its special power allows it to be discarded for some effect. Cards in the tableau cannot be discarded or replaced with other cards, except for those that have a power that allows them to be discarded.

The card power during the consume phase allows a player to draw one card. Therefore, even if the player has no goods to consume, they are still required to draw a card.

> Can a player place more than one development, or more than one settlement, in a single turn if he has the cards to do it?

No, a player cannot place more than one development or settlement in a single turn, even if they have the necessary cards. This is only possible if a power specifically allows it (which does not exist in the base game). However, if playing with the two-player advanced rules (where each player chooses two roles per turn), there could be two separate develop phases in the same turn, allowing a player to place up to two developments.

If a player has no consume power in their tableau, they do nothing and keep all their goods. If the player has a consume power but can only consume a single good, they use that power for one good and keep the remaining goods.

In a solitaire game, if I have Mining Robots and Mining League, which provide phase 5 abilities to produce on windfall worlds, does this allow me to place goods on two windfall worlds? Additionally, if I had chosen the phase 5 card, would I be able to produce on three windfall worlds?

 If someone else chooses the Produce phase, there will be a produce phase, allowing you to produce on two brown windfall worlds (as long as they don’t already have goods). Mining League and Mining Robots apply only to brown windfall worlds. However, if you choose the Produce phase, you get the produce bonus, which allows production on any windfall world.

 Yes, Galactic Imperium's +4 with the pink background applies only to Rebel worlds. Military strength with a white background applies to all military worlds, including Rebel worlds. Powers like those on Alpha Centauri and Alien Tech Institute work only for their respective colors (brown and yellow worlds), with Alien Tech Institute not applying to Alien Rosetta Stone World, which is a gray world despite having "ALIEN" in the name.

[6-cost-dev-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1347335/6-cost-dev-question)

> Does a player score for all the bullet points on a 6-cost development card, or only for the one that gives the highest points?

Yes, you score all of the points as listed on the development card. If the rules intended for you to score only the highest one, it would specify that. As it stands, the card explicitly tells you how to score, without indicating that only the highest point value should be counted. According to page 12 of the manual, "For these developments, score end-of-game VPs for every card in its owner’s tableau that satisfies one of the conditions listed on that development (and for every 3 VPs in chips its owner has in the case of Galactic Renaissance). For each 6-cost development, a given card can score in only one of its categories. Conditions listed in ALL CAPS are titles of specific cards. Therefore, for each listed card present in the owner’s tableau, award the indicated VPs."

> Can a player who picked Develop Trade use their develop discount in the second develop phase instead of the first, particularly if they have the Interstellar Bank and want to gain extra cards from both phases without placing anything during the first phase?

From page 8 of the manual, "If a player chooses either two Develop or two Settle actions, then two complete, sequential phases of that type occur (with this player receiving a bonus in each of them). If his opponent also chose one of these same actions, then his opponent receives a bonus only for the first of these two phases." This means that you only get the bonus in the first of the two phases in that kind of situation.
