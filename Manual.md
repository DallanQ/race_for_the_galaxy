## OVERVIEW (page 1)

In Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments.

Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phase’s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase.

For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur; otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from their hand of cards to build. After revealing these cards, each player adds their development to their tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from their hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as their bonus.

Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to their hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in their tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player’s hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases.

The player who best manages their cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins.

**The winner is the player with the most victory points.**

### Overview summary (Page 1)

Players simultaneously choose which game phases will occur. Game phases that nobody chooses do not occur. Each player receives a bonus in the phase that they chose.

Cards are used in three ways: as developments or worlds to be placed; as money; or as goods to be consumed or sold.

Players explore for useful cards, build developments, settle worlds, and produce goods. Goods can be consumed for victory points or sold for cards.

The player with the most victory points wins!

## SETUP (Page 2)

Place 12 victory point (VP) chips per player in **1** and **5 VP chips** nearby. Set aside the **10 VP chips** (and any left over chips) for use only during the final round of play.

Each player takes a set of seven different **action cards**.

Find and shuffle the five **start worlds**. Deal one world face up to each player. These form each player's initial card tableau.

**Your first game**: instead, for two players, use start worlds 1 and 2; for three, use start worlds 1–3; and, for four, use start worlds 1–4.

Shuffle the unused start worlds together with the **game cards**. Deal six face down cards to each player. Each player then examines these cards and discards two cards face down to the discard pile. The remaining game cards form the initial card supply.

**Your first game**: instead, each player uses the four numbered game cards matching their start world's number as their initial (preset) hand. After finding these preset hand cards, shuffle all the remaining game cards, including any left over start worlds and preset hand cards, together.

The start worlds, preset hands, and action card sets for your very first game have already been presorted.

If Alpha Centauri is in play, place a card from the card supply face down on top of it (as its starting windfall good).

> Each player has their start world and their starting action cards in front of them. In the center of the table, place the card supply, discard plie (face down and "messy"), and VP chips 3 players: remove 12, 2 players: remove 24 (set aside the 10 VP chips)

Each player’s card tableau is in front of them. It is one or more rows of face up cards: developments and worlds. Some worlds may have goods , represented by face down cards, on them. Initially, it contains only the player’s start world (and its windfall good, if it has one).

### Setup Summary (Page 2)

*Start worlds have numbered red and blue boxes in their upper left and lower right corners (these colorsare used in a future expansion). Preset hand cards have numbers without boxes.*

Set out 12 VPs per player in 1 and 5 VP chips. Set aside the 10 VP chips for later use.

Give each player a set of seven action cards and a random start world.

Shuffle the unused start worlds and game cards. Each player gets 6 cards and discards 2 of them.

The remaining cards form the card supply.

*Cards in the card supply and the discard pile are both face down. To tell them apart, keep the card supply neat and the discard pile a bit “messy”.*

Use 12 VPs per player.

A player's development and worlds are placed in a card tableau.

## PLAYING THE GAME (Page 3)

A game is played over several rounds (typically 7 to 11). At the start of a round, players simultaneously and secretly choose one action card, placing it face down in front of themselves. Once all players have done so, they turn these action cards face up. Then, the players perform the selected phases in order (I: Explore; II: Develop; III: Settle; IV: Consume; V: Produce), omitting every phase not chosen by at least one player.

Each phase has an action, which is performed by all players. In addition, the players who chose that phase get a bonus.

**Important**: if more than one player selects the same phase, its action is still only performed once (with all the players who selected that phase receiving a bonus).

The bonus for an action either modifies it (such as reducing its cost or doubling the VPs gained) or is in addition to it (such as a card draw afterwards or the opportunity to sell a good).

Players may find it useful to turn over the action card(s) for each phase as it is completed before performing the next one.

New players may find it useful to place the selected action cards in the center in numerical order. As players become more familiar with the phase order, this won't be necessary.

After all phases selected that round have been performed, each player must discard down to ten (game) cards in their hand and then reclaims the action card that they played that round.

Successive rounds are performed in the same manner until an end-of-game condition is met (see Game End below).

Game cards have three uses: as a development or world to be placed in a player's tableau; as one wealth to discard from one's hand face down when paying to place a development or world; or as a good placed face down on a world either upon it being settled or during production.

### Playing the Game Summary (page 3)

Each round, all players secretly choose and then reveal an action card.

Only phases selected by players are performed.

Perform the selected phases in numerical order:

- I Explore
- II Develop
- III Settle
- IV Consume
- V Produce

A phase has an action, performed by all players, and a bonus, performed only by the players who chose that action card.

At the *end* of a round, players must discard down to a hand limit of 10 cards.

Game cards have three uses, as:

- developments or worlds
- one wealth (money) to spend
- one good (on a world)

### I: EXPLORE (page 3)

Action: each player draws two cards and then simultaneously selects which one of them to add to their hand, discarding the other card face down in the center discard area.

All cards drawn are dealt out before any cards are discarded.

There are two possible Explore bonuses, depending on which Explore action card was chosen by a player.

A player who chose Explore: +5 draws five more cards to select from before making their choice. Such a player explores by drawing 7 cards and choosing 1 of them to add to their hand.

A player who chose Explore: +1, +1 draws one more card to select from and keeps another card. Such a player explores by drawing 3 cards and choosing 2 of them to add to their hand.

Thus, depending on the bonus chosen with the Explore action, a player can either have more cards to select from or gain an extra card to keep.

The powers of various cards can alter these rules if a player has them in their tableau, possibly providing extra card draws or allowing a player to keep additional cards.

#### Explore Summary (page 3)

Action: draw 2 cards; keep 1, discard the other.

*All explore draws are done before any player discards.*

Bonus (based on the action card chosen): draw 5 more cards or draw 1 more card and keep 1 more card.

>Icon of a eye with +2 inside and an icon of a hand holding a card with +1 inside

*Example: with this Explore power, a player (with no bonus) would draw four cards and keep two of them.*

### II: DEVELOP (page 4)

Action: each player places a development card from their hand face down, or no card if a player doesn't intend to place a development. Once all players have done so, they simultaneously turn them face up and then pay for them.

If desired, players can put their intended developments (if any) under their action card, revealing them when everyone is ready.

Each development has a (icon of a white diamond) symbol containing its cost, ranging from 1–6. To pay for a development, a player discards cards equal to this number face down from their hand.

Players who chose Develop, as the bonus, discard one card fewer than the development's cost. If, due to powers, a player is already discarding no cards, no bonus is received.

A player may not build a given development if another copy of it is currently in their tableau.

Next to a development's diamond is its victory point (VP) value. It adds to the player's final victory point total at the end of the game.

6-cost developments have (icon of a white hexagon with a black ? inside) listed as their victory point values. These are worth a variable number of victory points at the end of the game, as indicated on these cards.

The powers of various cards can alter these rules if a player has them in their tableau before the development phase begins.

#### Develop Summary (page 4)

Action: place and pay for a development.

*To indicate no development, some players “knock” on the table, others put a world instead face down and flip it over, others put a card down but pick it up saying “no” when all are ready. Agree on a convention.*

Bonus: discard one fewer card when paying for a development.

A player may have only one of any given development in their tableau.

Developments are worth victory points

> Icon of a hexagon with 2 inside indicating VPs

> Icon of a biege colored diamond with 6 inside

> Icon of a hexagon with ? inside

### CARD POWERS (Page 4)

Every development, and most worlds, list one or more powers. Standard powers are depicted by icons with no text description (see the reference sheet). Special powers have icons, highlighted phases, and text descriptions at the bottom of the card which begin with the corresponding phase number.

All powers modify rules and are cumulative. A power modifies only the rules listed in its description; all other rules still apply.

"Draw" — in all phases except Explore — means draw a card and add it to your hand. In Explore, it means draw a card and add it to the cards you then select from, as in the Explore rules.

If, due to powers, a cost is reduced below 0, it becomes 0. A player does not receive cards as a "refund" if this occurs.

A power does not take effect in the phase in which its card is placed; it can begin to take effect as soon as the next phase.

Thus, the Public Works power to draw one card after its owner builds a development does not apply to Public Works itself.

Unless a power's description uses the word "may", a power must be used, if possible, in the phase to which it applies (though a player may freely choose the order in which to invoke powers, as discussed further under Consume).

An optional power (such as a Colony Ship) must be used if it is needed to place a development or world which a player has selected and then revealed.

Powers are resolved sequentially (even though their effects can be cumulative). A player cannot "interrupt" one power with another.

#### Card Powers Summary (page 4)

Developments, and most worlds, grant powers.

*Power icons appear on the left side of cards, arranged in I to V phase order, allowing players to easily scan their tableaus for them during a phase.*

The chromsome icon (icon of a green, stylized, intertwined shape resembling a chromosome), (a green bold UPLIFT text), (a purple bold IMPERIUM text), and (a brown bold TERRAFORMING text) are for use in future expansion sets.

Powers first take effect in the phase after their cards is placed.

Powers must be applied if possible, unless the card text indicates otherwise.

### III: SETTLE (page 5)

Action: each player places a world card from their hand face down, or no card if a player doesn't intend to place a world. Once all players have done so, they simultaneously turn them face up and then pay for (or conquer) them.

Many worlds contain a black number, ranging from 0–6, in a black circle; this is the world's cost. To pay for such worlds, the player discards cards face down from their hand equal to this number.

Players who chose Settle, as the bonus, draw one card after placing and paying for (or conquering) a world.

Beside a world's circle is its victory point value. This adds to the player's final victory point total at the end of the game.

The powers of various cards can alter the settle rules if a player has them in their tableau before the settle phase begins.

**Windfalls**: some worlds have a colored "halo" around their circle, showing that they are windfall worlds and that a good is to be put on them when they are first settled. To do so, as part of placing the world in a player's tableau, they take a card face down — without looking at it — from the card supply and put it on top of the world's lower right portion (to avoid hiding the world's VPs and powers). This card represents a good of the kind indicated by the color of the world's halo.

There are four kinds of goods in the game:

- Alien technology (yellow box), artifacts left by the vanished Alien Overlords.
- Genes (green box), genetic material used in biological research.
- Rare elements (brown box), transuranic elements powering Jumpdrive.
- Novelty goods (blue box), such as artwork and entertainment.

**Military Conquest**: some worlds have red circles and, within them, a red outlined number, ranging from 1–7; this is the world's defense. These worlds cannot be placed by payment, but instead must be conquered. To conquer a world, a player's total Military must equal or exceed the world's defense. Then, the player simply places it — and its windfall good, if it has a halo — without paying for it (and then draws a bonus card if that player chose Settle).

Military is granted by powers of various start worlds, developments, or worlds, and lasts until the end of the settle phase.

Some developments and worlds, such as Empath World, subtract from a player's total Military.

New Military Tactics may be discarded from a player's tableau for +3 Military until the end of that settle phase.

A Contact Specialist enables a player to place and pay for a military world (except an Alien military world), at a cost equal to one less than the world's defense.

**Important**: this cost is not reduced by a player's Military (Military and payments never combine).

Cost discounts from Replicant Robots, Mining Robots, etc. do combine with a Contact Specialist to reduce the cost of placing a military world. Similarly, a Colony Ship allows a Contact Specialist to place a (non-Alien) military world at no cost.

Thus, there are two completely separate ways to place military worlds.

#### Settle Summary (page 5)

Bonus: draw a card after placing a world.

> Icon of a transparent circle with a black border and 5 inside, beside the icon is aother icon of a white hexagon with 3 inside.  The icon represents VPs

Worlds are worth victory points.

> Icon of a white circle with a black border, a brown background shadow and a black 2 inside, on the top right corner of the circle is a small brown circle with a red border and beside the white circle is a hexagon with black border and 0 inside

Military worlds (with red circles) must be *conquered* to be placed.

The three icons above represnt defense

To conquer a military world, the player’s Military must equal or exceed its *defense*. The player then places the world for no cost.

A *Contact Specialist* allows a player to place a military world by paying for it, *instead* of conquering it.

### IV: CONSUME (page 6)

Action: all players must use their consume powers, if they have any, to discard goods for victory point chips and/or card draws.

Some powers consume several goods. Others consume goods of a specific kind. Some, such as Deficit Spending, consume cards, not goods, discarded from a player's hand. A few powers, such as New Economy, don't involve discarding anything; they simply take effect during a Consume phase.

Goods are discarded face down (without examining them). Each good being discarded applies to only one consume power. A good may or may not be on the world consuming it. If a consume power could consume several possible goods, the player chooses which good(s) to consume.

Consumption is mandatory. However, consume powers can be invoked in any desired order, even if this results in some unconsumed goods left over that could have been consumed with a different order (due to their kinds or number not matching the player's remaining unused consume powers).

Each consume power can be used only once in a consume phase. Some powers allow multiple goods, "up to" some number, to be discarded, with each good producing an effect. Such powers must be fully used, if possible, when invoked.

Thus, a player with a tableau containing three novelty goods, New Vinland, and Free Trade Association, cannot consume two goods using FTA's power (to consume up to 3 novelty goods for 1 VP and a card apiece) and then, based on the cards received, decide to consume the third novelty good using New Vinland's power (to consume a good for two cards). The third novelty good must now be consumed by FTA.

(These powers could have been invoked in the reverse order, but this choice must be made before invoking FTA's power — once a power is invoked, its resolution cannot be interrupted by another power.)

There are two possible Consume bonuses, depending on which Consume action card was chosen by a player.

**$: Trade:** players who chose Consume: Trade must sell one good (before applying their consume powers), by discarding it and drawing a number of cards that depends on the kind of good sold: Alien technology: 5 cards; Genes: 4 cards; Rare elements: 3 cards; or Novelty: 2 cards. Unlike consuming goods, no Trade power is needed to sell a good.

Only players who chose Consume: Trade can sell a good.

Players choosing Consume: Trade also apply all relevant Trade powers (listed next to **$**) to this sale (typically, to draw extra cards).

Players who chose Consume: 2x VPs double the number of victory point chips — but not any other effects — that their consume powers provide.

Exception: VPs for discarding cards from your hand (from powers such as Deficit Spending or Merchant World) are not doubled by this bonus.

### V: PRODUCE (page 7)

Action: place a good on each production world (worlds with colored, solid circles) without a good, by taking a card face down — without looking at it — from the card supply and putting it on top of the world's lower right portion (to avoid hiding the world's VPs and powers). This good is of the kind indicated by the color of the world's solid circle (and the color of the corresponding Produce power).

No world can have more than one good. Place a good on the lower right portion of a world to avoid hiding the world's VPs or powers. Some worlds, such as Gem World, provide a card draw as part of producing a good. If a good is already present, then no cards are drawn.

Players who chose Produce, as the bonus, produce a good (if possible) on one of their windfall worlds that does not already have a good.

Some cards, such as Genetics Lab, can also produce goods on windfall worlds (without goods).

Others, such as Pan-Galactic League, provide a card draw for each world of a specific kind in a player's tableau (such as Genes worlds, with either a green halo or a green solid circle).

#### Produce Summary (page 7)

Action: place a good on each world without a good that produces one.

Bonus: produce a windfall.

> An image of a torn Race for the Galaxy card, on one half of the card is an icon of a green card beside a hand holding a white card with a black 2 inside and on the other half of the card is an icon of a hand holding a white card with 2 inside upside down.

*Icons for produce powers that provide cards or windfalls are listed twice, once in the icon bar and once on the top, right corner of each card, as an aid when dealing out production.*

## ROUND END, CARDS, AND CHIPS (Page 7)

After all chosen phases are done, players must discard down to 10 (game) cards before starting the next round.

All discards are face down. Keep the discard pile a bit "messy" so that it is not confused with the card supply.

When the card supply is exhausted, immediately reshuffle the discards to form a new card supply.

All players' VP chips and the number of game cards they have in their hands are open for examination. Make change among VP chips as needed.

### Round End, Cards, and Chips Summary (page 7)

Discard down to 10 cards at the end of each round.

Dicards are face down and "messy".

## GAME END (Page 7)

The game ends at the end of the round (including discarding) in which:

- a player has 12 or more face up cards in their card tableau, or

(A player can end with more than 12 cards in their card tableau by placing both a development and a world in the final round.)

- the last victory point chip is given out.

If victory point chips run out, add the 10 VP chips and make change so that all victory points earned in the final consume phase can be taken.

Total each player's development and world VPs, VP chips, and any end of game VPs for 6-cost (icon of a hexagon with ? inside) developments (see page 12).

The player with the highest total is the winner!

If two or more players tie, the player among them with the highest total number of cards in hand (after discarding) and goods on worlds wins.

If there is still a tie, then all the tied players win.

### Game End Summary (page 7)

The game ends after:

- a player ends a round with 12 or more cards in tableau, or

- the VPs chips run out.

Finish the final round. Use the 10 VP chips if necessary.

Each player totals:

- tableau card VPs

- VP chips

- VPs for developments

The player with the most VPs wins!

***After a game**, separate the start worlds by fanning the deck, looking for boxed numbers in the lower right-hand corners.*

## TIMING (Page 8)

Mostly, play can and should be performed simultaneously.

However, there are a few cases where player order can matter, such as:

- when there are only a few cards left in the card supply, or

- when the VP chips might run out in a Consume phase, or

- when players are resolving settling near the end of the game.

Near the end of the game, if several players have New Military Tactics or Colony Ships, one player may wish to know whether another player is using (and discarding) one of these cards or placing a twelfth card in their tableau (thus ending the game that round), before deciding whether to use one of these cards themselves.

In this and similar cases, resolve the phase in clockwise order (after simultaneously placing any cards), starting with the player who has the lowest numbered (original) start world.

### Timing Summary (page 8)

Resolve any timing issues clockwise from the player with the lowest numbered (original) start world.

## 2 PLAYER GAME (for experienced players) (Page 8)

Initially, two players should just play the standard rules. Once you're familiar with the game, play with the following changes:

- Each player uses a full set of nine action cards and chooses two of them at the start of each round.

- A player selecting both Explore bonuses draws eight cards and keeps two of them (plus the effects of any applicable powers).

- If a player chooses either two Develop or two Settle actions, then two complete, sequential phases of that type occur (with this player receiving a bonus in each of them). If their opponent also chose one of these same actions, then this opponent receives a bonus only for the first of these two phases. Powers placed in the first such phase can be used in the second one.

- A player who selects both Consume bonuses must sell one good before consuming other goods for double VPs.

### 2 Player Game (for experienced players) Summary (page 8)

> An image of a slot with two projections.

2 player game: use all nine action cards, choosing two action cards at the start of each round.

> Image of six Race for the Galaxy cards.

**Start world choice for experienced players**. During setup, separate the start worlds by number into odd (red) and even (blue) groups. Shuffle and deal two face down worlds, one from each group, to each player. Shuffle the remaining start worlds with the game cards and deal six cards to each player. Each player examines all eight cards before discarding one of their two start worlds and two of their six game cards. Players then simultaneously reveal their selected start worlds and begin play.
